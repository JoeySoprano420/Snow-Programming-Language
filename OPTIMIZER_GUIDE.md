## üéØ Optimization Techniques

### 1. Constant Folding ‚ú®

**What it does:**  
Pre-computes constant expressions at compile time.

**Example:**
```snow
# Before optimization
let x = 5 + 3;
let y = 10 * 2;

# After constant folding
let x = 8;      # Computed at compile time
let y = 20;   # Computed at compile time
```

**Dodecagram Benefits:**
```snow
let dozen = 10 + 2;    # Folded to 12 (base-12)
let gross = 10 * 10;   # Folded to 100 (144 decimal)
```

**IR Transformation:**
```
# Before
MOV R1, 5
MOV R2, 3
ADD R3, R1, R2

# After
MOV R3, 8
```

---

### 2. Dead Code Elimination üóëÔ∏è

**What it does:**  
Removes code that doesn't affect program output.

**Example:**
```snow
# Before optimization
let x = 5;
let y = 10;    # Never used
let z = x + 1;
Say(z);

# After DCE
let x = 5;
let z = x + 1;
Say(z);
```

**IR Transformation:**
```
# Before
MOV R1, 5
MOV R2, 10    # Dead - R2 never read
ADD R3, R1, 1
CALL Say

# After
MOV R1, 5
ADD R3, R1, 1
CALL Say
```

---

### 3. Peephole Optimization üîç

**What it does:**  
Optimizes small instruction sequences.

**Patterns Detected:**

#### Redundant Moves
```
# Before
MOV R1, R1

# After
NOP (removed)
```

#### Algebraic Identities
```
# ADD with 0
ADD R1, R2, 0  ‚Üí  MOV R1, R2

# MUL with 1
MUL R1, R2, 1  ‚Üí  MOV R1, R2

# MUL with 0
MUL R1, R2, 0  ‚Üí  MOV R1, 0
```

#### Instruction Chaining
```
# Before
MOV R1, 5
MOV R2, R1

# After
MOV R1, 5
MOV R2, 5
```

---

### 4. Loop Unrolling üîÑ

**What it does:**  
Duplicates loop body to reduce loop overhead.

**Example:**
```snow
# Before
let i = 0;
every 10ms:
    Say(i);
    i = i + 1;
    if i >= 5:
    break;
end;

# After unrolling (factor 5)
Say(0);
Say(1);
Say(2);
Say(3);
Say(4);
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces branch overhead
- Enables more optimizations
- Better instruction pipelining

**Dodecagram Sweet Spot:**  
Loops with 12, 6, 4, 3, or 2 iterations (divisors of 12)

---

### 5. Tail Call Optimization üìû

**What it does:**  
Converts tail-recursive calls to jumps.

**Example:**
```snow
# Before
Fn factorial(n, acc)
    if n <= 1:
        ret acc;
    ret factorial(n - 1, n * acc);  # Tail call

# After TCO
Fn factorial(n, acc)
    loop:
    if n <= 1:
    ret acc;
        acc = n * acc;
        n = n - 1;
        goto loop;
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates stack frames
- Prevents stack overflow
- Faster execution

---

### 6. Vectorization (SIMD/AVX) ‚ö°

**What it does:**  
Converts scalar operations to SIMD instructions.

**Example:**
```snow
# Array processing
let i = 0;
every 1ms:
    array[i] = array[i] * 2;
    i = i + 1;
    if i >= 100:
 break;
end;

# Vectorized: Process 4 elements at once
# Uses SSE/AVX instructions
```

**IR Transformation:**
```
# Scalar
LOOP:
  LOAD R1, [array + i]
    MUL R1, R1, 2
    STORE [array + i], R1
    INC i
 JNE LOOP

# Vectorized
LOOP:
    VLOAD V1, [array + i]      # Load 4 values
    VMUL V1, V1, 2       # Multiply 4 at once
    VSTORE [array + i], V1     # Store 4 values
    ADD i, 4
    JNE LOOP
```

---

### 7. Look-Ahead Optimization üëÄ

**What it does:**  
Reorders instructions to hide latency.

**Example:**
```
# Before (pipeline stalls)
LOAD R1, [mem1]    # 3 cycles
ADD R2, R1, 5      # Stalls waiting for R1
LOAD R3, [mem2]    # Could execute earlier

# After (no stalls)
LOAD R1, [mem1]    # 3 cycles
LOAD R3, [mem2]    # Executes in parallel
ADD R2, R1, 5      # R1 ready by now
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves instruction throughput
- Reduces pipeline bubbles
- Better CPU utilization

---

### 8. Bounds Check Elimination ‚úÇÔ∏è

**What it does:**  
Removes redundant array bounds checks.

**Example:**
```snow
# Before
let i = 0;
every 1ms:
    if i < arrayLength:        # Bounds check
        process(array[i]);
    i = i + 1;
end;

# After BCE (proved i < arrayLength)
let i = 0;
every 1ms:
    process(array[i]);         # Check eliminated
    i = i + 1;
end;
```

---

### 9. Branch Chain Optimization üåø

**What it does:**  
Simplifies chains of conditional jumps.

**Example:**
```
# Before
JMP L1
L1:
    JMP L2
L2:
    JMP L3
L3:
# actual code

# After
JMP L3
L3:
    # actual code
```

**Also eliminates:**
- Redundant branches
- Unreachable code after unconditional jumps
- Empty blocks

---

### 10. Loop Fusion (Curling) üîó

**What it does:**  
Merges adjacent loops with the same bounds.

**Example:**
```snow
# Before
let i = 0;
every 10ms:
    a[i] = a[i] + 1;
 i = i + 1;
    if i >= 10:
        break;
end;

i = 0;
every 10ms:
    b[i] = b[i] * 2;
    i = i + 1;
    if i >= 10:
   break;
end;

# After fusion
let i = 0;
every 10ms:
    a[i] = a[i] + 1;
    b[i] = b[i] * 2;
 i = i + 1;
    if i >= 10:
     break;
end;
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces loop overhead
- Better cache locality
- Fewer iterations

---

### 11. Synchronized Scheduling üéØ

**What it does:**  
Schedules instructions for optimal pipeline utilization.

**Considers:**
- Instruction latencies
- Resource dependencies
- Pipeline stages
- CPU ports

**Result:**  
Maximum instruction-level parallelism (ILP)

---

### 12. Footprint Compression üì¶

**What it does:**  
Minimizes memory and register usage.

**Techniques:**

#### Register Coalescing
```
# Before
MOV R1, value
MOV R2, R1
USE R2

# After
MOV R1, value
USE R1
```

#### Stack Frame Minimization
- Reuses stack slots
- Eliminates unused locals
- Packs variables efficiently

---

### 13. Adaptive Tuning üéõÔ∏è

**What it does:**  
Optimizes for specific hardware characteristics.

**Optimizations:**

#### Cache Locality
- Groups frequently accessed data
- Aligns data structures
- Prefetches memory

#### Branch Prediction
- Places likely branches first
- Aligns branch targets
- Reduces mispredictions

---

### 14. Profile-Guided Optimization üìà

**What it does:**  
Uses runtime profiling data to guide optimizations.

**Process:**
1. **Instrument** code with counters
2. **Run** with representative workload
3. **Collect** execution statistics
4. **Recompile** with profile data

**Optimizations Based on Profile:**

#### Hot Path Optimization
```
# Profile shows function A called 90% of time
# Inline A and optimize aggressively

# Profile shows branch taken 95% of time
# Place taken path inline, jump to not-taken
```

#### Block Reordering
```
# Before (cold blocks mixed with hot)
HOT_BLOCK_1:
    # frequently executed
COLD_BLOCK_1:
    # rarely executed
HOT_BLOCK_2:
    # frequently executed

# After (hot path together)
HOT_BLOCK_1:
    # frequently executed
HOT_BLOCK_2:
    # frequently executed
COLD_BLOCK_1:
    # rarely executed
```

## üî¨ Dodecagram-Specific Optimizations

### Base-12 Arithmetic Optimization

**Division by 12:**
```
# Naive
DIV R1, R2, 12

# Optimized (using shifts and adds)
# x / 12 ‚âà (x * 0xAAAB) >> 19 (for 32-bit)
MOV R3, 0xAAAB
MUL R1, R2, R3
SHR R1, R1, 19
```

**Multiplication by 12:**
```
# Naive
MUL R1, R2, 12

# Optimized
# x * 12 = (x << 3) + (x << 2)
MOV R1, R2
SHL R1, 3      # x * 8
MOV R3, R2
SHL R3, 2      # x * 4
ADD R1, R3     # x * 12
```

### Dozisecond Timing Optimization

**Temporal Loop Optimization:**
```snow
# Before
every 1ms:
    # Inefficient timing

# After
every 10ms:    # Base-12 aligned
    # Better cache behavior
    # Less timer overhead
```

## üöÄ Advanced Topics

### Custom Optimization Passes

You can extend CIAM with custom optimizations:

```cpp
class MyCustomPass {
public:
    void OptimizeDodecagramPatterns(IR::Function& func) {
        // Your optimization logic
    }
};

// Add to CIAM pipeline
optimizer.AddCustomPass(myCustomPass);
```

### Optimization Hints

Add hints in Snow code:

```snow
## OPTIMIZE: unroll ##
every 10ms:
    # Loop will be aggressively unrolled
end;

## OPTIMIZE: vectorize ##
let i = 0;
every 1ms:
    # Will be vectorized if possible
end;
```
